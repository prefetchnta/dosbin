Welcome to GRX 2.4.9!

GRX is a 2D graphics C library originaly written by Csaba Biegl for
DJ Delorie's DOS port of the GCC compiler.

The library is compiled with gcc 4.7.1

GRX fonts are installed in a standard djgpp location:
%DJGPP%\share\grx\fonts 
(similar to 
%DJGPP%\share\texmf\fonts 
%DJGPP%\share\groff\font 
in DJGPP and to more others in linux)
They are known by default by defining during compilation
GRX_DEFAULT_FONT_PATH=/dev/env/DJDIR/share/grx/fonts

When compiling it was supposed that other graphics libraries
available for DJGPP have been installed:
jpeg6bb.zip (or ljpeg6bb) png1216b.zip tiff312b.zip zlib123b.zip
This causes no harm, if you have not installed, and do not use, them.
These libraries are linked in C only by issuing explicitly 
-ljpeg -lpng -ltiff -lz	during compilation
and in Pascal (GPC) by commenting (out) {L ...} instructions
at the beginning of the import units gpc.pas and graph.pas.

There is no harm in installing side by side GRX and MGRX.
The only conflict is between auxiliary binaries	contained in the
bin directory, but they are functionally identical, and are used only
for some testing purpose.

If you do not like this, download the sources v2tk/grx249s.zip from
djgpp mirrors, or from the official site of GRX
   http://www.gnu.de/software/GRX/
and recompile following instructions contained in them.


GRX binary installation instructions
====================================

1 - unzip on top of your djgpp tree, preserving directory structure.

    e.g. if you have downloaded the binary in c:\temp

     cd c:\djgpp
     unzip32 c:\temp\grx249b.zip

2 - optionally set the default driver and graphics mode info

       SET GRX20DRV=<driver> gw <width> gh <height> nc <colors>

     Available drivers are:
       herc, stdvga, stdega, et4000, cl5426, mach64,
       ati28800, s3, VESA, memory

3 - for gcc users link with -lgrx20 -lpc -ljpeg -lpng -ltiff -lz -lm
    (if you need all extra graphics libraries)

4 - for gpc users, include in your programs

uses grx        (native grx functions)
    or
uses graph	(Borland bgi emulation)

and compile with the option

   --unit-path=c:/djgpp/units
